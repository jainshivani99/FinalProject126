# CS 126 Final Project
## English to Chinese Number Translator
## By: Shivani Jain

### Description:

This application is an English to Chinese Number Translator, which gives the user the ability to draw a number on the canvas in English, and their output will include the Chinese character, Chinese pinyin with tones, and audio clip of the pronunciation of the number. It will also display the picture that the user drew, and what English number the classifier classified it as. It is a very hands-on approach to learning numbers in Chinese, especially for beginners. Having learned Chinese myself for four years in high school, and understanding how difficult it is to learn, I feel like this application would have been really useful and exciting to use. My future goal is to convert this OpenFrameWorks application into an iOS application so it can be readily available, and the first person I would like to show the app to is my Chinese teacher from high school :)

#### How to Use:

Start Screen:

Once the user opens the application, this is the start screen. By clicking and dragging their mouse, they are able to draw on the screen. If they want to clear the screen, they can click anywhere on the screen. The user should draw the number they want on the canvas portion of the screen to get the most accurate results, like this:

Once they have drawn the number they want to translate, they should press the enter key. Pressing the enter key will take them to their results page, which looks like this:

The Chinese character is shown in the middle. At the top right they can see the picture that they drew, and the English representation of the number beneath it. It also shows the Chinese pinyin representation of the number underneath that. The user is then able to press 'P' to hear the Chinese pronunciation of the number. They can press 'Q' to go back to the start screen to draw another number. If the classifier is not able to classify the image, it produces an error message on the results page, like this:
